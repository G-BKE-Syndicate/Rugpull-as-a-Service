# Rugpull-as-a-Service (RaaS)

> **"Rug responsibly. Pull with pride."**

Welcome to the protocol no one asked for, but everyone participates in.

---

## Overview
RaaS is the decentralized infrastructure for institutional betrayal, startup vaporware, and liquidity vanishing acts. This repo captures the culture, the chaos, and the code that fuels the **Great Unraveling**.

---

## Features
- **Press Release Generator** – Auto-apologize for your rugpull with sincerity.exe
- **RugBot 3000** – Simulates your project roadmap in reverse
- **VC Pitch Deck Template** – Raise $200M to build a JPEG swapper, exit by Q2
- **Smart Contracts That Self-Destruct** – Inspired by real events
- **NFT Mint & Drain Mechanic** – Because art is temporary but loss is forever

---

## Roadmap (Backwards)
- **Q4 2025:** Twitter space apology tour
- **Q3 2025:** Tweak tokenomics to "adaptive vapor mechanics"
- **Q2 2025:** Fake partnership with Fortune 100 company
- **Q1 2025:** Launch with hype + zero product

---

## Ethos
**“This isn’t just code—it’s performance art.”**

RaaS is a mirror. We don’t endorse rugs.
We **document** them.

---

## Get Involved
- Fork this. Fork everything.
- Add your favorite rugs to `raas-core/historical/`
- Submit PRs with new utilities like `RugAlert`, `ExitLiquidityCalc`, or `DAOEvaporator`

**Built on vibes. Funded by disbelief. Documented for posterity.**
## License
**Vaporware License v0.1**

If you rug someone using this code:
1. You owe us 69% of the stolen liquidity,
2. A public apology in meme format,
3. And a full-length interpretive dance posted to chain.

No warranties. No refunds. Maximum chaos.
